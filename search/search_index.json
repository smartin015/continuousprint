Action Commands are messages sent by the printer to OctoPrint when a user performs an action on the printer's display. Standard Action Commands OctoPrint supports several actions out of the box - see here for more details. Proper handling of these commands by Continuous Print is still under development . Your printer firmware must also support action commands for this to work (see Firmware Support for Action Commands below). Custom actions for Continuous Print Currently, the Continuous Print plugin supports a single custom action command: // action:queuego When received from the printer, this message instructs the Continuous Print plugin to start managing the queue - equivalent to clicking \"Start Managing\" on the UI. This command is non-standard and requires additions to firmware - in particular, a custom menu entry must be added in CUSTOM_MENU_MAIN of Configuration_adv.h for Marlin firmware which issues a M118 //action:queuego command. Firmware support for Action Commands Not all printers support Action Commands - it depends on the firmware they're running. The easiest way to know if your printer supports action commands is to watch the Terminal tab in OctoPrint for occurrences of // action:<command> . If these appear e.g. when a print is cancelled from the printer's interface, then it's supported. Adding support for action commands for your printer involves updating the printer's firmware, which is a device-specific process. Check for user-contributed firmwares which include this support - for Marlin-based firmwares for instance, you want to ensure HOST_ACTION_COMMANDS is defined in the firmware (see here ).","title":"Action Commands"},{"location":"action-commands/#action-commands","text":"If you interact with your 3D printer using its display (touchscreen, LCD, or similar), you may be interested in action commands.

Sets and Jobs The queue is actually made up of two levels: sets and jobs. Sets are a single print file, printed one or more times. You created a set by following the \"Add prints to the queue\" step in the quickstart . Jobs are a collection of sets, printed one or more times. Jobs are always printed sequentially, from the top of the queue to the bottom. \"Add\" behavior By default, every print file you add (as a set) is appended to a default, unnamed job at the end of the queue. If you give this job a name (by clicking the title box, typing a name, then hitting enter or clicking away) it will stop collecting new prints and a new default job will be created when the next print is added. Example 1: Batched strategy Let's consider an empty queue. If you add A.gcode with 5 copies and B.gcode with 5 copies, the print order will be: AAAAA BBBBB This is great if you want all of your A files to print before all your B files, for instance when you're working on a project that uses A but plan use B for something later. Example 2: Interleaved strategy Let's start again with an empty queue, but now suppose we add A.gcode with 1 copy, B.gcode with 1 copy, then set the job count to 5 . The print order will now be: AB AB AB AB AB This is exactly the pattern you would want if you were, for example, printing a box with A.gcode as the base and B.gcode as the lid. Each box would be completed in order, so you can use the first box without waiting for all the bases to print, then for the first lid to print. Example 3: Combined strategy From an empty queue, you could even add A.gcode with 1 copy and B.gcode with 4 copies, and set the job count to 3 . The outcome is then: ABBBB ABBBB ABBBB We're simply mixing examples 1 and 2 together, but this would be ideal for a base print with multiple smaller additions - a table with four legs, for instance. Drag and drop reordering At any time, you can click and drag jobs and sets with the grips on the left (the two vertical lines): Dragging a job reorders it among the jobs in the queue. Dragging a set reorders it within a job. Tip You can also drag a set from one job to another! Note however that this may change the total number of that file printed if the destination job has a different count than the origin job.","title":"Queuing Basics"},{"location":"advanced-queuing/#queuing-basics","text":"In the quickstart we covered the basics of adding prints to the queue and running them, but you can do much more once you understand the nested structure of the print queue.","title":"Queuing Basics"},{"location":"advanced-queuing/#sets-and-jobs","text":"The queue is actually made up of two levels: sets and jobs.

If you just want to run the plugin, see Getting Started . This guide is based on the octoprint plugin quickstart guide Docker setup Docker is a tool that allows you to run processes in isolated containers. A docker setup is included with CPQ for development purposes, meaning you don't have to install anything (other than Docker) on your computer in order to get up and running. Install Docker on your computer, then read on to learn how to start developing with CPQ. Note If you prefer to not use docker, proceed to \"Manual setup\" below. First, download the repository (you could alternately fork and use your own repository here, for easier contributing later): git clone https://github.com/smartin015/continuousprint.git Then start a new container using docker-compose (this is installed by default in most Docker installations, but check here if the command isn't found): docker-compose run --service-ports dev1 /bin/bash The container will start with the repo volume-mounted at /home/oprint/continuousprint . Register the plugin in dev mode so that live edits can be made: cd ~/continuousprint && octoprint dev plugin:install Then start the server: octoprint serve You can now visit it at http://localhost:5000 . Manual setup Read on to learn how to set up a development environment on your machine, without using Docker. 1. Install octoprint from source Install octoprint locally: git clone https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint cd OctoPrint virtualenv venv source venv/bin/activate pip install -e . 2. Install dev tools Important Perform this step in a different terminal - NOT using the venv we set up for OctoPrint. The dev dependencies are known to conflict with OctoPrint's dependencies and can break your OctoPrint installation. It is recommended to fork this repository so that it's easier to submit your changes back to the main repo later (see \"Submit a pull request\" below). git clone https://github.com/smartin015/continuousprint.git cd continuousprint pip install -r dev-dependencies.txt pre-commit install You can verify good installation by running pre-commit run --all-files . If everything passes, you're good to go. 2. Install and start the continuous print plugin in local dev mode In the same terminal as the one where you activated the environment (see step 1), install the plugin in dev mode and launch the server: cd ../continuousprint octoprint dev plugin:install octoprint serve You should see \"Successfully installed continuousprint\" when running the install command, and you can view the page at http://localhost:5000 . Optional steps for easier development A couple of optional changes can improve your developer flow: YAML configs Edit OctoPrint's yaml config to turn off minification and ignore startup errors (at continuousprint/volume/config.yaml in the Docker container, else in your OctoPrint install path): ignoreIncompleteStartup: true devel: webassets: bundle: false minify: false minify_plugins: false Turning off minification in particular will help when chasing down error messages - without this change, client-side errors become garbled and hard to root-cause. Debug logging Enable debug-level messages from ContinuousPrint by going into Settings > Logging and adding octoprint.plugins.continuousprint at DEBUG level at the bottom of that page. Click Save and the log level will be updated. Editing docs Continuous Print uses mkdocs to generate web documentation. All documentation lives in docs/ . pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material if you installed the dev tools (step 2) you can run mkdocs serve from the root of the repository to see doc edits live at http://localhost:8000 . 3. Run unit tests to verify changes When you've made your changes, it's important to test for regressions. Run python tests with this command: python3 -m unittest *_test.py Frontend unit tests require some additional setup (make sure yarn and its dependencies are installed): cd .../continuousprint yarn install yarn run test This will run all frontend JS test files ( continuousprint/static/js/\\*.test.js ). You can also yarn run watch-test to set up a test process which re-runs whenever you save a JS test file. 4. Install a dev version on OctoPi Users of OctoPi can install a development version directly on their pi to test their changes on actual hardware. Warning Editing code - especially unfamiliar code - can lead to unpredictable behavior. You're controlling a robot that can pinch fingers and melt plastic, so be careful and consider using the built-in virtual printer before a physical test. ssh pi@<your octopi hostname> and provide your password (the default is raspberry , but for security reasons you should change it with passwd when you can) git clone https://github.com/smartin015/continuousprint.git Uninstall any existing continuous print installations (see Settings -> Plugin Manager in the browser) cd continuousprint && ~/oprint/bin/python3 setup.py install Note that we're using the bundled version of python3 that comes with octoprint, NOT the system installed python3. If you try the latter, it'll give an error that sounds like octoprint isn't installed. 5. Submit a pull request When you've made and tested your changes, follow the remaining instructions for contributing to projects to create a pull request. Important New pull requests must be submitted to the rc branch, not to the master branch . Additonally, the plugin version line in setup.py must have an incremented rc number (e.g. 1.5.0rc2 -> 1.5.0rc3 , 1.6.1 -> 1.6.2rc1 ). This allows users to test the \"release candidate\" and shake out any bugs before everyone receives the change. You should receive a review within a day or so - if you haven't heard back in a week or more, email the plugin author . Tips and Tricks This is a collection of random tidbits intended to help you get your bearings. The backend ( __init__.py and dependencies) stores a flattened representation of the print queue and iterates through it from beginning to end. Each item is loaded as a QueueItem (see print_queue.py ). The frontend talks to the backend with the flattened queue, but operates on an inmemory structured version: Each flattened queue item is loaded as a CPQueueItem (see continuousprint/static/js/continuousprint_queueitem.js) Sets of the same queue item are aggregated into a CPQueueSet (see continuousprint/static/js/continuousprint_queueset.js) Multiple queuesets are grouped together and run one or more times as a CPJob (see continuousprint/static/js/continuousprint_job.js) For simplicity, each level only understands the level below it - e.g. a Job doesn't care about QueueItems. Octoprint currently uses https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/ for icons. Drag-and-drop functionality uses SortableJS wrapped with Knockout-SortableJS, both of which are heavily customized.

It's not unusual to have multiple 3D printers - in home workshops, in the prototyping industry, and even for 3D printing services (e.g. Shapeways) and manufacturers that manage hundreds/thousands of them. In addition to providing a local queue by default, Continuous Print also configures a default LAN queue that will automatically link any other printers on your local network. Printers can then coordinate together over the network to print jobs from the same queue. Important LAN queues are intended for trusted, local (LAN) networks only - not for cross-network (WAN) use cases. Using LAN queues across networks is insecure and strongly discouraged. Info If you upgraded from v2.0.0 or earlier , the default LAN queue will not be added (a compatibility measure). If you don't see the default LAn queue, please read and follow Additional LAN Queues for instructions on how to set up your own. Setup By default, Continuous Print creates a queue called \"LAN\" that printers on the network will automatically join. You will need a working instance of OctoPrint (with the Continuous Print plugin installed) for every printer you wish to have join the queue. See what printers are connected to the queue by hovering your mouse over the queue name: If printers are missing from this list, make sure they have OctoPrint and Continous Print installed and enabled, and that they are on the same local network. See Additional LAN Queues below if you need more advanced LAN queue configuration. Submit a job Submitting a job is as simple as dragging it from the \"local\" queue to your LAN queue. After confirming that you wish to submit your job, the job will be moved out of the local queue and into the LAN queue. Warning Currently, LAN queue submission is somewhat destructive - the job cannot be modified or reverted once it's submitted, only deleted. If you have a very complex job to submit, consider saving it before submission so you have a backup. Cancel a job Click the checkbox next to the job in your LAN queue. Click the trash can icon that appears. The job will disappear from the LAN queue and no longer be printed. Note that a job cannot be deleted if a printer is actively printing it. Details LAN Queues manage Jobs, not Sets/Files Queues operate at the level of a Job (see Sets and Jobs for disambiguation). All work described by the job will be completed by the printer which acquires it. In other words, the work within a job will not be distributed across printers . This is to ensure compatability with future work to support WAN / decentralized network printing, ensuring that all prints of any job are guaranteed to end up in the same physical location. Queue Strategies When a printer is done with its job, it will choose the next one based on whichever strategy is configured for the queue it's printing from. There is currently only one strategy: In-Order prints linearly down the queue from top to bottom, one job at a time. In the future, you will be able to customize how your printer works on the queue, e.g. choosing jobs in a way which avoids excessive filament changes and other manual actions. The overall strategy between queues is currently in-order, i.e. all prints in the topmost queue will be executed before moving onto the next queue, and so on. This will eventually change to allow a top-level strategy which dictates which queue to print from. GCODE Limitations 3D print slicers generate a *.gcode file for a particular make and model of 3D printer - running that file on a different printer than the one for which it was sliced would likely damage that printer (or maybe just fail to print properly). This can be mitigated in one of two ways: Use exactly the same make and model of printer for all members of the LAN queue Configure the correct profiles for all Sets so that each type of printer has its own compatible *.gcode files to fully print the job. Info For users of Kiri:Moto slicer , the second mitigation is automatic: gcode files are automatically analyzed and the printer profile applied when they are added to the queue. See the Printer Profiles page for more details. Additional LAN Queues It's straightforward to add additional LAN queues, or remove/modify the default LAN queue if desired: Open OctoPrint's settings page Click through to Continuous Print Click the Queues button to go to the queue settings page. Click the \"Add Queue\" button to add a new LAN queue. Fill in the inputs, but keep in mind: Each queue must have a unique name (which cannot be local and archive - these are reserved) Address:Port must be either set to auto or have the form of ip_address:port (e.g. 192.168.1.43:6789 ) A hostname of localhost will only connect to other OctoPrint instances on the same host. If you're unsure what to specify here, try 0.0.0.0 which binds to all IP addresses on the host . If auto is used, an IP address and port will be selected automatically - this will probably work, but may not be correct for more complicated network setups. Access control may be a factor if you're using a port number below 1024 (see privileged ports ) You may experience silent failures if you specify a port that's already in use by another process. All LAN queues are only visible to other devices on the same network, unless you've taken steps to expose ports (NOT recommended). When you've finished configuring your queues, click Save . If everything is working properly, you'll see the changes reflected in the queues on the Continuous Print tab with the queue(s) you added.

You can hover over individual labels to see more details on what material is specified.","title":"Selecting materials"},{"location":"material-selection/#behavior","text":"When the print queue reaches a set with a specific material selected, it will wait to start the set until you select a matching spool via SpoolManager for every tool with a specified material. Note that the material (e.g. \"PLA\") and the color are all that's matched. If for instance you have more than one spool of black PLA, selecting any of these spools in SpoolManager is sufficient if the print requires black PLA.","title":"Behavior"},{"location":"printer-profiles/","text":"Printer Profiles Printer Profiles restrict the make/model of printer that's allowed to print certain files. Why have profiles? 3D print slicers generate a *.gcode file for a particular make and model of 3D printer - running that file on a different printer than the one for which it was sliced would likely damage that printer (or maybe just fail to print properly). In the case of a single printer running a single OctoPrint instance, this doesn't usually matter - typically only compatible GCODE files will end up in the Files list. But with LAN Queues , multiple kinds of printers may be vying for the same print Job and compatibility becomes a problem. Setting your printer's profile In Settings > Plugins > Continuous Print , in the Scripts > Printer Profile section, select the manufacturer and model of your printer. If your printer is not present in the list, follow these directions to add it. When you click Save , this profile will be associated with your printer. Automatic profile assignment Starting with version 2.1.0 , Continuous Print will attempt to automatically infer the correct printer profile for gcode files added to the queue. This currently only works for Kiri:Moto slicer . If you want your slicer to be supported, open a Feature Request and include an example gcode script that you've sliced as an example. Assigning and removing printer profiles to/from Sets Click the edit (pencil) button on a Job in your queue to enter edit mode. Expand your desired Set by clicking the triangle next to its name. Next to Profiles: you will see a drop-down. Click this and select a matching profile for your printer. A new label should appear with the profile name. You can add additional profiles if your Set can be printed by other printers. Remove any unwanted profiles by clicking the X next to them. Click the \"Save\" button at the bottom of the Job to save your changes. Behavior If a Set has no associated profiles, any printer will attempt to print it. This is fine if you have all the same type of printer, but becomes a hazard if you have multiple incompatible printers sharing the same LAN queue (e.g. a continuous belt printer and a small delta printer). If a Set has one or more associated profiles, your printer will only print it if the printer's profile is present . For instance: a printer with the Generic profile will not print a Set with only a Creality CR30 profile. All sets within jobs in LAN queues MUST have an assigned profile , or else you will not be able to submit them. This is to ensure that gcode files areprinted only by the correct printer.","title":"Printer Profiles"},{"location":"printer-profiles/#printer-profiles","text":"Printer Profiles restrict the make/model of printer that's allowed to print certain files.","title":"Printer Profiles"},{"location":"printer-profiles/#why-have-profiles","text":"3D print slicers generate a *.gcode file for a particular make and model of 3D printer - running that file on a different printer than the one for which it was sliced would likely damage that printer (or maybe just fail to print properly).
