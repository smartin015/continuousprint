Sets and Jobs The queue is actually made up of two levels: sets and jobs. Sets are a single print file, printed one or more times. You created a set by following the \"Add prints to the queue\" step in the quickstart . Jobs are a collection of sets, printed one or more times. Jobs are always printed sequentially, from the top of the queue to the bottom. \"Add\" behavior By default, every print file you add (as a set) is appended to a default, unnamed job at the end of the queue. If you give this job a name (by clicking the title box, typing a name, then hitting enter or clicking away) it will stop collecting new prints and a new default job will be created when the next print is added. Example 1: Batched strategy Let's consider an empty queue. If you add A.gcode with 5 copies and B.gcode with 5 copies, the print order will be: AAAAA BBBBB This is great if you want all of your A files to print before all your B files, for instance when you're working on a project that uses A but plan use B for something later. Example 2: Interleaved strategy Let's start again with an empty queue, but now suppose we add A.gcode with 1 copy, B.gcode with 1 copy, then set the job count to 5 . The print order will now be: AB AB AB AB AB This is exactly the pattern you would want if you were, for example, printing a box with A.gcode as the base and B.gcode as the lid. Each box would be completed in order, so you can use the first box without waiting for all the bases to print, then for the first lid to print. Example 3: Combined strategy From an empty queue, you could even add A.gcode with 1 copy and B.gcode with 4 copies, and set the job count to 3 . The outcome is then: ABBBB ABBBB ABBBB We're simply mixing examples 1 and 2 together, but this would be ideal for a base print with multiple smaller additions - a table with four legs, for instance. Drag and drop reordering At any time, you can click and drag jobs and sets with the grips on the left (the two vertical lines): Dragging a job reorders it among the jobs in the queue. Dragging a set reorders it within a job. Tip You can also drag a set from one job to another! Note however that this may change the total number of that file printed if the destination job has a different count than the origin job.","title":"Advanced Queuing"},{"location":"advanced-queuing/#advanced-queuing","text":"In the quickstart we covered the basics of adding prints to the queue and running them, but you can do much more once you understand the nested structure of the print queue.","title":"Advanced Queuing"},{"location":"advanced-queuing/#sets-and-jobs","text":"The queue is actually made up of two levels: sets and jobs.

If you just want to run the plugin, see Getting Started . This guide is based on the octoprint plugin quickstart guide 1. Install octoprint from source Install octoprint locally: git clone https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint cd OctoPrint virtualenv venv source venv/bin/activate pip install -e . 2. Install dev tools Important Perform this step in a different terminal - NOT using the venv we set up for OctoPrint. The dev dependencies are known to conflict with OctoPrint's dependencies and can break your OctoPrint installation. It is recommended to fork this repository so that it's easier to submit your changes back to the main repo later (see \"Submit a pull request\" below). git clone https://github.com/smartin015/continuousprint.git cd continuousprint pip install -r dev-dependencies.txt pre-commit install You can verify good installation by running pre-commit run --all-files . If everything passes, you're good to go. 2. Install and start the continuous print plugin in local dev mode In the same terminal as the one where you activated the environment (see step 1), install the plugin in dev mode and launch the server: cd ../continuousprint octoprint dev plugin:install octoprint serve You should see \"Successfully installed continuousprint\" when running the install command, and you can view the page at http://localhost:5000 . Editing docs Continuous Print uses mkdocs to generate web documentation. All documentation lives in docs/ . pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material if you installed the dev tools (step 2) you can run mkdocs serve from the root of the repository to see doc edits live at http://localhost:8000 . 3. Run unit tests to verify changes When you've made your changes, it's important to test for regressions. Run python tests with this command: python3 -m unittest *_test.py Frontend unit tests require some additional setup (make sure yarn and its dependencies are installed): cd .../continuousprint yarn install yarn run test This will run all frontend JS test files ( continuousprint/static/js/\\*.test.js ). You can also yarn run watch-test to set up a test process which re-runs whenever you save a JS test file. 4. Install a dev version on OctoPi Users of OctoPi can install a development version directly on their pi to test their changes on actual hardware. Warning Editing code - especially unfamiliar code - can lead to unpredictable behavior. You're controlling a robot that can pinch fingers and melt plastic, so be careful and consider using the built-in virtual printer before a physical test. ssh pi@<your octopi hostname> and provide your password (the default is raspberry , but for security reasons you should change it with passwd when you can) git clone https://github.com/smartin015/continuousprint.git Uninstall any existing continuous print installations (see Settings -> Plugin Manager in the browser) cd continuousprint && ~/oprint/bin/python3 setup.py install Note that we're using the bundled version of python3 that comes with octoprint, NOT the system installed python3. If you try the latter, it'll give an error that sounds like octoprint isn't installed. 5. Submit a pull request When you've made and tested your changes, follow the remaining instructions for contributing to projects to create a pull request. Important New pull requests must be submitted to the rc branch, not to the master branch . Additonally, the plugin version line in setup.py must have an incremented rc number (e.g. 1.5.0rc2 -> 1.5.0rc3 , 1.6.1 -> 1.6.2rc1 ). This allows users to test the \"release candidate\" and shake out any bugs before everyone receives the change. You should receive a review within a day or so - if you haven't heard back in a week or more, email the plugin author . Tips and Tricks This is a collection of random tidbits intended to help you get your bearings. The backend ( __init__.py and dependencies) stores a flattened representation of the print queue and iterates through it from beginning to end. Each item is loaded as a QueueItem (see print_queue.py ). The frontend talks to the backend with the flattened queue, but operates on an inmemory structured version: Each flattened queue item is loaded as a CPQueueItem (see continuousprint/static/js/continuousprint_queueitem.js) Sets of the same queue item are aggregated into a CPQueueSet (see continuousprint/static/js/continuousprint_queueset.js) Multiple queuesets are grouped together and run one or more times as a CPJob (see continuousprint/static/js/continuousprint_job.js) For simplicity, each level only understands the level below it - e.g. a Job doesn't care about QueueItems.

Restart OctoPrint That's it! Now let's configure it to work with your printer. Want cool features? There's much more automation on the way ! To help speed up development and get features early (and if you don't mind the odd bug here and there), turn on Release Candidates under Settings -> Software Update (more info here ) Configure the plugin Go to Settings -> Continuous Print and ensure the bed cleaning and queue finished scripts are correct for your 3D printer. You can also enable settings here for compatibility with The Spaghetti Detective for automatic retries when the print starts failing. Add prints to the queue Navigate to the file you wish to add in the Files dialog on the left of the page. Add it to the print queue by clicking the + button to the right of the file name. If you want to print more than one, you can click multiple times to add more copies, or set a specific count in the Continuous Print tab. Use Jobs to group your print files The queue is actually made up of two levels: sets and jobs. Sets are a single print file, printed one or more times. You created a set by following the \"Add prints to the queue\" step above. Jobs are a collection of sets, printed one or more times. By default, every print file you add (as a set) is appended to a default, unnamed job at the end of the queue. If you give this job a name (by clicking the title box, typing a name, then hitting enter or clicking away) it will stop collecting new prints and a new default job will be created Example 1: Batched Let's consider an empty queue. If you add A.gcode with 5 copies and B.gcode with 5 copies, the print order will be: A A A A A B B B B B This is great if you want all of your A files to print before all your B files, e.g. if you're working on a project that uses A but plan use B for something later. Example 2: Interleaved Let's start again with an empty queue, but now suppose we add A.gcode with 1 copy, B.gcode with 1 copy, then set the job count to 5 . The print order will now be: A B A B A B A B A B This is exactly the pattern you would want if you were, for example, printing a box with A.gcode as the base and B.gcode as the lid. Each box would be completed in order, so you can use the first box without waiting for all the bases to print, then for the first lid to print. You can mix and match Start the queue Safety check! If you glossed over \"Configure the plugin\" above, read it now. Seriously. You can permanently damage your printer if you don't set up the correct GCODE instructions to a clear the bed and finish the queue. Supporting specific printer profiles is on the to-do list , but not yet available, so you'll have to do this on your own for now. The print queue won't start your prints just yet. To run the queue: Click the 'Continuous Print` tab (it may be hidden in the extra tabs fold-out on the right) Double check the order and count of your prints - set the count and order using the buttons and number box to the right of the queued print, and delete with the red X . Click Start Managing . The plugin will wait until your printer is ready to start a print, then it'll begin with the top of the queue and proceed until the bottom. Note that when it's time to clear the print bed or finish up, a temporary cp\\_\\*.gcode file will appear in your local files, and disappear when it completes. This is a change from older \"gcode injecting\" behavior that is necessary to support at-commands in the clearing and finish scripts. Inspect queue items As the print queue is managed and prints complete, you can see the status of individual prints by clicking the small triangle to the left of any individual queue item. This opens a sub-panel showing individual print stats and results. Stop the queue When all prints are finished, the plugin stops managing the queue and waits for you to start it again. If you need to stop early, click Stop Managing . Important The queue may not be managed any more, but any currently running print will continue printing unless you cancel it with the Cancel button. Clean up the queue Click the triple-dot menu in the top right corner of the plugin tab for several convenient queue cleanup options. You can also remove individual queue items with the red X next to the item. Troubleshooting If at any point you're stuck or see unexpected behavior or bugs, please file a bug report . Be sure to include system info and browser logs so the problem can be quickly diagnosed and fixed.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting-started/#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting-started/#install-the-plugin","text":"In the OctoPrint UI, go to Settings -> Plugin Manager -> Get More Search for \"Continuous Print\", and click Install, following any instructions If you can't find the plugin, you can also put https://github.com/smartin015/continuousprint/archive/master.zip into the \"...from URL\" section of the Get More page.

Sets are a single print file, printed one or more times. You created a set by following the \"Add prints to the queue\" step above. Jobs are a collection of sets, printed one or more times. By default, every print file you add (as a set) is appended to a default, unnamed job at the end of the queue. If you give this job a name (by clicking the title box, typing a name, then hitting enter or clicking away) it will stop collecting new prints and a new default job will be created Example 1: Batched Let's consider an empty queue. If you add A.gcode with 5 copies and B.gcode with 5 copies, the print order will be: A A A A A B B B B B This is great if you want all of your A files to print before all your B files, e.g. if you're working on a project that uses A but plan use B for something later. Example 2: Interleaved Let's start again with an empty queue, but now suppose we add A.gcode with 1 copy, B.gcode with 1 copy, then set the job count to 5 . The print order will now be: A B A B A B A B A B This is exactly the pattern you would want if you were, for example, printing a box with A.gcode as the base and B.gcode as the lid. Each box would be completed in order, so you can use the first box without waiting for all the bases to print, then for the first lid to print.

Bed Cooldown Threshold is the temperature in Celsius that once met triggers the bed to clear. The goal is to pick a temperature at which the part becomes free from the bed.

Enabling material selection Octoprint doesn't know by default what spools of filament you have on hand, nor what's loaded into which hotend of your printer. For this reason, we'll need to install SpoolManager , which manages all spool informations and stores it in a database. Follow the setup instructions for SpoolManager, then restart OctoPrint. To confirm everything's operational, go to Settings > Continuous Print and scroll to \"Material Selection\". If you see \"Material selection is enabled\", then you're good to go! Important Continuous Print only knows about the materials that you've defined in SpoolManager. Be sure to add a few spools before trying to select materials, or else you won't see any options available. Selecting materials When you add a new print file to the queue, it assumes nothing about material by default - any material type and color will be used to print it. Materials are implemented at the level of Sets (see here for definition). If you want a set to print in a certain color or material, click the triangle next to its name. If material selection is enabled (as above), you should see drop-down boxes for each extruder your printer has.
