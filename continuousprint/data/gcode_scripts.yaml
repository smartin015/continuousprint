  - name: "Advance Belt Short"

  - name: "Pause"
    description: >
      Use this script if you want to remove the print yourself but use the queue to keep track of your
      prints. It uses an @ Command to tell OctoPrint to pause the print. The printer will stay paused
      until you press "Resume" on the OctoPrint UI.
